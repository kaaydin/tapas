# Work Contribution

Below, we provide an overview of group member contributed to which parts of the entire project so far. 

![Overview](https://github.com/unisg-scs-asse/tapas-fs23-group5/blob/tapas-at-runtime/tapas-deliverables/mid-term-deliverables/images/work-contribution-overview.png "Tapas Application Architecture")

Unfortunately, we did not have anyone with extensive Java experience on our team. However, we were all very motivated to learn & contribute a lot for this project. Having such motivated team members helped us to distribute the project work across the team very fairly. 

While Kaan & Michael were mainly involved in building up the microservices for the Executor Pool and Roster, Daniel & Stephan focused on writing tests & conducting the performance testing.

The remaining work was distributed on ad-hoc basis (e.g., documentation, executors). 

We organized regular check-ins throughout the week (mainly Tuesdays & Thursday) so that we were able to help each other when we had issues or needed a distribution of work. 

Note: At the begining of our project, we had an additional member, but this person dropped out of the MCS programm. This person did not contribute a lot during this project, thus we excluded him from the overview.
